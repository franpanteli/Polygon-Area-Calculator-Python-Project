# Polygon-Area-Calculator-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the fourteenth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Polygon-Area-Calculator.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Polygon-Area-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Polygon-Area-Calculator.py)). This defined a class for rectange objects. Multiple methods were introduced as part of this, which performed operations on said objects. These first included calculating their dimensions (perimeters, areas and diagonals). Secondly, the ability to print these rectangle objects, provided that they were not more than 50 asterisks in width or height - in which case an error message was returned. A second class for squares was defined based on this, which inherited methods from the rectangle class (since a square was a special case of rectangle). This included further methods, to update the length parameter of this. The requirements for these classes were exported as a PDF from the project UI and annotated with [in-depth problem solving approaches](https://github.com/franpanteli/Polygon-Area-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf). These were written into Python in the project [Polygon-Area-Calculator.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Polygon-Area-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Polygon-Area-Calculator.py) file, which was submitted to mark the successful completion of the fourteenth project in the certification.
